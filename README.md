# Messboard
A tiny message board project, currently consisting of two apps:

## Api
An HTTP API for delivering, receiving and managins messages on a per-user-basis.

## Base
Basic models and stuff that are shared between other apps. Currently the only "other app" is `api` of course, but there are plans for a browser frontend that will probably also need these.
