# Messboard
A tiny message board project, using django. Currently consists of three apps:

## Api
An HTTP API for delivering, receiving and managing messages on a per-user-basis. Currently not integrated with django auth, so not working.

## Base
Basic models and stuff that are shared between other apps.

## Sajt
Frontend for the project.
